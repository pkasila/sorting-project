# Sorting arrays
A group assignment at the Lyceum BSU on sorting arrays using different sorting algorithms.

# What is this project?
This project is a project that groups of students at the Lyceum BSU had to complete afterwards
studying the theory of sorting algorithms in C++. It was necessary to compare different sorting algorithms.

# What has been done?
- [x] Generation of source data
- [x] Slow sorting algorithms (`selection`, `insertion`, `swap`/` bubble`)
- [x] Fast sorting algorithms (`merge`, `qsort`, comparison with `std::sort`)
- [x] Scripts for testing and data collection
